# Winternote
Winternote is a kind of WYSIWYG editor which doesn't use contentEditable property.

### Winternote
Many web editors use contentEditable or designMode for editing. That functionality is the easiest way to make edit on the way.
But, lack of standards makes result of markup by editors on each browser were so different. That problem doesn't solve with filters,
because browsers are always updated and period of their release are uncountable.

Winternote aim to provide same action and interfaces on all browsers.
